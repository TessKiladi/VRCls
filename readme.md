# VRCls - VRChat list

This is a tool to scrape your VRChat log file and see who is in the world with you.
This tool has additional functionality when combined with a discord bot - allowing 
you to see the discord roles of the people with you from the perspective of one discord.

## Building

The code in this repository is designed to be built using MSYS2;
you will need 
- g++
- meson
- ninja
I'm sure I'm missing things.

To Invoke the build, run
`./task build`

The `task` file manages all aspects of the build process.
