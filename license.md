# VRCls Source License

VRCls source is provided so that anyone who wishes to examine the code and/or build it for themselves rather than trust binaries from me is free to do so.
However, this repository will never contain any configuration files necessary to verify against the associated discord bot.
Partially this is to prevent random queries against minimal server capacity, and partially this is because I don't want to reveal which communities are using this system;
that is for the community to reveal, not a github repo.

**I Provide no warrenty of any kind for the code contained in this repository**

This is a hobby project in my spare time for communities that I love. However, I can't afford to warrenty this code. 
It is as good as I can make it in the time I've spent on it, no more, no less.

If you find a bug, report it to the issue tracker.

If you are looking at this code anywhere other than https://github.com/TessKiladi/VRCls... then the code you are looking at is outside of my control and I'm not even going to look at bug-reports.

You May:

- Copy the code.
- Build the code.
- Make changes to the code.
- Run your modified code against your own discord bot.

You May Not: 
- Make changes to the code and then distribute them claiming that it is from the original code
- use your modified version with my discord bot without asking me first.
